Well, time has come. I am trying to find a way to finance my site, since I have in mind a ton of ideas that need funding. Also, I am probably going to make a new page, a shop. I will be updating the welcome page (https://avunit.tk/) daily with new colors. I know, pretty boring, but in around ~unspecified long time~ I will be making an entirely new welcome page. Also, I'll make a go-fund-me, a patreon and probably display ads (unlikely). Also, all donations are open. 

> Happy summer!
