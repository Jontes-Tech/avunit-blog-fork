I have wanted a website for a LONG time and i finally got over my laziness and figured it out. I can say that this project in itself taught me more about website development and it took a while. If you can consider 3 days "a while", then that's great! Here's what you are going to need:

> GitHub, a domain (you can get one from free from freenom.com, just like I did), a Cloudflare account, some free time, and Jonte's help <3

Building websites is pretty complicated. It took me a while to get it running. I've had many issues with Cloudflare and GitHub not registering my domains. What I've learned from this project is:

- HTML and CSS.
- A lot about GitHub. A LOT. If you go to my GitHub, you can see many failed push attempts and empty repo's, but at least i learned by going trough my mistakes!
- Handling and working with Linux's terminal.
- How a website works in general.
- How to register a domain, how to buy one, and a lot more.

So you see, building a website learned me some stuff. And if you want to build your own and learn, go ahead! Dn't mind the days lost trying to figure it out, in the end I promise you everything's going to work out in your favour <3
