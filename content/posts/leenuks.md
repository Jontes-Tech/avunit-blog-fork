Alright, you probably heard about Linux before, but what is it?

Linux (LEE-nuuks) is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution. The most popular linux distributions as of the writing of this post are: Ubuntu (ew), Manjaro, Fedora, Arch, Gentoo, etc. Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project.

Now, that was a lot of words. To make it easier to understand, Linux is an operating software just like Windows and Mac OS. Linux can be based on multiple distros, such as Arch, Debian, Fedora, etc. Linux is also not that hard to learn. Yes, using Arch linux might be harder but you can use Manjaro at the begining or Ubuntu (if you are a masochist).

> Linux is a terminal based OS. The terminal can use multiple "shells", such as bash, zsh, fish, etc. To learn more, visit this link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell

Now, you decided to install Linux. But HOW?
Here's what you're going to need.

- A functioning Windows/Mac OS computer.
- An USB Drive bigger than 8GB.
- An active internet connection.
- Balena Etcher (free)
- Linux distribution ISO (also free)

Let's say you decided on a distro. Good job! Download the ISO for it, pretty straight forward. Next, download balena etcher from here: https://www.balena.io/etcher/ and install it. Now, open balena etcher, select the downloaded ISO, select your USB, and hit flash. This process might take from 1 minute to 30 minutes, depending on the transfer speed of your USB Drive.

Now, get ready to say bye bye to your current OS. Make sure you back up all important data before proceeding. Now, turn off your computer. When booting it back up again, enter BIOS or boot menu. Key combinations should be: 

> Acer: F2 or DEL
> ASUS: F2 for all PCs, F2 or DEL for motherboards
> Dell: F2 or F12
> HP: ESC or F10
> Lenovo: F2 or Fn + F2
> Lenovo (Desktops): F1
> Lenovo (ThinkPads): Enter + F1.
> MSI: DEL for motherboards and PCs
> Microsoft Surface Tablets: Press and hold volume up button.
> Origin PC: F2
> Samsung: F2
> Sony: F1, F2, or F3
> Toshiba: F2

When you're in BIOS, head to boot order and put your USB Drive on number 1 priority. 
Save changes and reboot. Your computer will now boot to Linux ðŸ¥³

Continue with the installation. If you can't figure it out I'll link some tutorials below:

Great job! Now you got Linux fired up on your system. Now, you might notice that it doesn't look so nice as you expected. You can customimze your distro to your heart's content. Here's how my distro looks:

You can obviously make yours look way diferent, and that's what i love about it. Look up tutorials, wiki's, just have fun learning. And don't forget, happy Linuxing!
